# Learning HTML and CSS Repository

Welcome to my Learning HTML and CSS Repository! This repository is a collection of code that I've written as I learn various HTML and CSS concepts. Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own learning journey.

## About

This repository is a personal project to document my progress and understanding of front-end web development using HTML and CSS. Each folder corresponds to a specific concept or topic I've learned, and the code within each folder reflects my exploration and practice.

Feel free to navigate through the folders to explore different aspects of HTML and CSS.

## Usage

If you find any code that is helpful or if you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome!

To view the HTML and CSS code, you can simply open the HTML files in a web browser. For more complex projects, consider using a code editor and a local development server.


Happy coding!
